This project is designated for recognizing and classifying handwritten digits from images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture from MNIST dataset. The model is trained on 60,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) and evaluated on 10,000 test images. The CNN
architecture includes three convolutional layers, followed by max pooling, flattening, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy.

Key steps:
1. Data preprocessing
2. CNN architecture
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Performance analysis

As a result, this model successfully classifies handwritten digits with a 98% accuracy
